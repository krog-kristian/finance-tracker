# Fire Financial

A full stack JavaScript React app for personal finance tracking.

## Why I Built This

My wife introduced me to a book called "Your Money or Your Life" by Vicki Robin and Joe Dominguez.
This book teaches the importance of knowing where ever penny in your life comes from and goes.
I built this app to help me keep track of where and what I spend my money on.
